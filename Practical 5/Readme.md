# ðŸŽ“ Teachers Rating Dataset Analysis

## ðŸ§­ Objective  
The objective of this practical is to apply **probability theory** and conduct a **two-tailed hypothesis test** using the **Teachersâ€™ Rating Dataset**.  
The goal is to determine statistical insights such as the likelihood of certain evaluation scores and whether observed teaching ratings significantly differ from a hypothesized population mean.  
Python libraries such as **NumPy** and **pandas** were used for all statistical computations.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

The dataset used is named **`ratings`**, which includes records of **university professors** along with their teaching evaluation scores and various personal and course-related attributes.

| Column     | Description                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Prof`     | Professorâ€™s name or unique identifier (may appear multiple times)           |

| `Tenure`   | Whether the professor is tenured (`Yes`) or untenured (`No`)                |
| `Beauty`   | Perceived beauty score (numerical) assigned to the professor                |
| `Rating`   | Teaching evaluation score (scale from 1 to 5) given by students             |
| `Students` | Number of students who submitted evaluations for that professor             |
| `Age`      | Age of the professor in years                                               |
