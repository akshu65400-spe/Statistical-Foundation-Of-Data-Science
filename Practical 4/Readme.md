# ðŸŽ“ Student Rating Dataset Analysis

## ðŸ§­ Objective  
The aim of this practical is to analyze a **Student Rating Dataset** using Python libraries such as **NumPy**, **pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.  
This analysis explores how demographic and professional factors â€” including **age**, **gender**, **tenure status**, and **minority representation** â€” influence **student evaluation scores**.
